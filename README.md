# SVG-Logo-Maker
This is the Day 10 challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivation was learning how to build an logo with using node. It helped me understand what API is and how to work on it javascript
Why did you build this project?
I built this project to understand how to use node.js.
What problems does it solve?
The problem it opens is that you have to use the right function and correct was of spelling becuase then node won't have a clue on what you jsut wrote. It helped me solved my mistakes of mispelling and how to use functions.
What did I learn?
I learned about node and using the teremal as well.
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out because it shows the way the user can pick their shape, color and font they want to use. 

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css, and Javascript to use my project.
I used my git bash to commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Task-Board project. I also used weather API to get the key.
